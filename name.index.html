  <h2>LA 458 Exercise 1</h2><br>
  <p>Hello! I am Amelia Abrahams, but I prefer to be called <b>Amy</b>! I am from Central Iowa where I grew up in the two very small towns of Albion and Liscomb. Liscomb has a population of about 200 people so I take knowing your neighbors to a whole new level. I live on a "ranch" with my horses and many other animals.<br>
    I am the first person in my four familes (divorced parents) to go to a university. That makes me really proud. I am a Junior in Community and Regional Planning and I am looking to obtain the GIS Certificate. <br>
    I plan on staying right here in Central Iowa, but I have plans to travel to every national and state park throughout my lifetime, whether that be for horseback riding or for hiking. I also want to travel the world. I would love to see our neighbors in Canada and travel to Europe. Africa is also on the list as my mother and I want to see the wild elephants.</p>
